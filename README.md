# Pentagram: Instagram, but with AI Images (Unfinished)

This project uses python for the backend and typscript and react for the frontend to create an Instagram clone where the users can generate images with AI. I used a hugging face model, Stable Diffusion, to ensure low latency performance. This project was made for my residency at Headstarter

## Tech Stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React
- **Backend**: Modal (for serverless GPU hosting and image generation)
- **Image Generation Model**: Stable Diffusion, Hugging Face
- **Database**: Vercel Blob for storing image URLs and prompts
